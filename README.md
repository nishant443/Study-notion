# 📝 Notion-style Auth Project

This is a Notion-inspired project where I’ve implemented **Login** and **Signup** pages using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. It serves as the authentication foundation for a larger Notion-like application, focusing on clean design and responsive layouts.

## 🚀 Features

- ⚛️ Built with React (Functional Components & Hooks)
- 🎨 Styled using Tailwind CSS
- 🔐 Authentication UI: Login and Signup forms
- 📱 Fully responsive design
- 💡 Easy to integrate into larger apps
